# Social-Network-analysis-of-Fitness-Data

This project is used to establish relationships between the various factors that are sources of motivation and the overall outcome of workout on the concentration levels of a person.
The 3 main objectives we have tried to establish are:

1. Identifying what are the most common sources of motivation (Friends, Family, Celebrities or Politicians)
2. Finding what is the source of motivation for each age-group range
3. Were the concentration levels of the individual high on the days they worked out?

Apart from these, we also found out the values of a number of graph parameters such as degree centrality, density, clustering level, most influential node and least influential node for each network. 
The data collection was done using a Google Form followed by relevant pre-processing. 
The networks were constructed using "networkx" package in python.
The jupyter notebooks are arranged as Objective 1, Objective 2 and Objective 3 corresponding to each of the objectives mentioned above.
